**Before Following the steps make sure your quadcopter is fully assembled with flight controller firmly fixed at the center of frame without motors attached without battery connected for safety reasons.
*any damage caused due to improper handling is not in our scope.
*RemoteXY Library needs to be copied to the arduino libraries location

///////////////////////////////
Baud Rate changing for ESP8266
///////////////////////////////

1) For Sucessfull Communication we need to set the baud rate of communication at 19200 for ESP as well as Main Firmware
2) Open Step1_ESP_Programming & Upload via programmer to Flight Controller
3) Set Serial Monitor to both NL & CR & baud rate to 9600
4) Enter AT and press Enter if your get 'OK' then continue else check the above setting
5) Enter 'AT+CIOBAUD=19200' if your get 'OK' You have sucessfully set the communication baud rate
6) If Completed Sucessfully continue to Upload Step2 Code

///////////////////////////////
Initial Setup for Quadcopter
///////////////////////////////

1) Open Step2_DroneTreX_Initial_Setup & Upload via programmer to Flight Controller
2) Set the Baud Rate of Serial monitor to 57600
3) Connect the mobile with 'DroneTreX' network with password '12345678'
4) Once connected press any key and send to continue with setup process on serial monitor
5) Follow the On Screen Steps to Configure your Quadcopter
6) Retry if error message is display with proper attention to mistakes
7) Once you get the sucessfull message you can continue with motor testing code

///////////////////////////////
Motor Testing for Quadcopter
///////////////////////////////

*Now connect you motors & battery to the quadcopter and disconnected the positive supply from the programmer module only RX,TX & GND would be connected with 
flight controller
*Donot attach the propeller

1) Open Step3_DroneTreX_Motor_Test & Upload via programmer to Flight Controller
2) Set the Baud Rate of Serial monitor to 57600
3) Connect the mobile with 'DroneTreX' network with password '12345678'
4) Once connected press any key and send to continue with setup process on serial monitor
5) Follow the On Screen Steps to Configure your Quadcopter
6) Here you check the rotation and speed of quadcopter individual motors 
7) Once all the parameters are checked you will get a sucessfull message you can now continue with the main firmware code

///////////////////////////////
Programming Main Firmware
///////////////////////////////

1) Open Step4_DroneTreX_Firmware_Ver2 & Upload via programmer to Flight Controller
2) Connect the mobile with 'DroneTreX' network with password '12345678'
3) If you have sucessfully completed step1 & step2 then you can arm the quadcopter by making the throttle low and rudder left
4) For disarming throttle low and rudder right
5) Tune the PID Setting for Yaw Pitch & Roll for maximum stability. 
6) The PID gains are already set to value with best result & stability (You can fine tune it to make it more stable for your own drone)

int pid_max_yaw = 400;                     //Maximum output of the PID-controller (+/-)

(P gain determines how hard the flight controller works to correct error and achieve the desired flight path )
(I term determines how hard the FC works to hold the drone’s attitude against external forces, such as wind and off-centered CG )
(D gain works as a damper and reduces the over-correcting and overshoots caused by P term )
for PID working you can visit https://oscarliang.com/quadcopter-pid-explained-tuning/ or search over internet


1) The above are the code area from where you can change the PID Gain for your Drone in Step4_DroneTreX_Firmware_Ver2 code
2) PID Values mentioned are tuned values for your quadcopter model you can easily tune the PID following procedure of PID tuning from any video from internet
3) PID is the main factor affecting stability and proper PID tuning is necessary for controlled and stable flight
4) Have Fun!
